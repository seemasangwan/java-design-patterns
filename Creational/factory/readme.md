Factory Design Pattern

Factory Design Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides a way to create objects from a centralized place without exposing the object creation logic to the client.
It is useful when the type of object needs to be decided at runtime and makes it easy to add new object types.

Key Points

Object creation happens at one centralized place (factory class)
Object type can be decided at runtime
Client code does not know how the object is created
Easy to extend by adding new object types


Factory Pattern creates objects through a factory class instead of directly using new, hiding the creation logic and allowing object type to be decided at runtime.
